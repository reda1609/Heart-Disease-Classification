# Heart Disease Classification Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify heart disease using various algorithms. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data, with an emphasis on minimizing false negatives to prioritize patient safety.

## Key Features
- **Algorithms Used**: Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Support Vector Machine.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, scaled features, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated models using accuracy and recall metrics, with a focus on recall to minimize false negatives.
- **Tools and Libraries**: Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various patient attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other medical indicators. It is available in the `heart.csv` file.

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy and recall scores across multiple models.
- Demonstrated the ability to handle and analyze medical data effectively.
- Applied best practices in machine learning to improve diagnostic accuracy.
